# HW4
## Titanic data analysis to predict whether someone survived or did not survive.
1.	Load the data from the csv file
2.	Clean the data:
> * Drop Na
> * Drop irrelevant features 
4.	Play with data
> * Age mean
> * Age histogram
5.	Graphs to check assumptions and correlations
> * Check correlation of survival by sex
> * Check correlation between the survival and the age variable.
> * Check correlation between the ticket fare and the survival
> * Scatter graph of the age, the fare and the survival
> * Correlation of parch and the survival
> * Correlation of pclass and the survival.
> * is fare ticket indicator for survival
6.	Prediction models and accuracy
> * Create and fit a nearest-neighbor classifier - KNN
> * SVC  - 3 different kernels - linear, Poly and RBF
7. The best prediction score is 0.85 (SVC,RBF kernel)
